Try making a commit to a new branch, which is a clone of the master branch. This clone can be "pushed" to update the master branch. 
One thing we still need to do is make it possible to commit code from the team member's terminal directly to the target github branch.
That way if you use a text editor through terminal to code, a simple terminal command can make it possible for you to commit your changes: https://dont-be-afraid-to-commit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/git/commandlinegit.html.
